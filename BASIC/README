SYSPREP_CHECKER

Not a very advanced one, but interestingin any case. How many times have you asked yourself 'hey, is this OS a clean install
or a (lazy IT tech work)* clone'?

In case you asked, you can find out running this piece of code. It looks on the registry for some specific keys, created by
the sysprep process when it runs to create the image for cloning.
