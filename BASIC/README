Readme for basic scripts

SYSPREP_CHECKER

Not a very advanced one, but interesting in any case. How many times have you asked yourself 'hey, is this
OS a clean install or a (lazy* IT tech work) clone'?

In case you asked, you can find out running this piece of code. It looks on the registry for some specific
keys, created by the sysprep process when it runs to create the image for cloning.

CIPHER

Another simple script, that converts characters and symbols into their ASCII number, and splits lines each
8 characters. A very basic encryption, but I'm more interested in the conversion and simple formatting than
in long, complicated algorithms.



* Lazy is not an insult, as laziness keeps the world moving. There is nothing as lazy as an engineer: they
are paid to think ways to do the same work, with less effort: lazyness paradigm.
