# PS-scripting

SUMMARY

A bunch of PowerShell scripts, to automate some tasks and maybe useful for system administrators.


TECHNICAL DATA

All scripts here are written on PowerShell, MS Windows command line or any lineal combination of
both. I tested them on Windows 6.x (Win Vista, Win 7 and Win8.x) and, some of them also on Win 10.

As far as I tried, they are written (and developed for) PowerShell 2.0, looking for a wider deploy,
and hence make them the most useful I can. No addons are used, for the reason above.

Scripts are commented in English, for a better understanding.

Look at each script README and CHANGELOG for description, adaptation and tracking changes and bugs. 


WHAT IS HERE, AND HOW IT'S STORED

You will find two folders, called BASIC and ADVANCED.

BASIC folder contains scripts wich provides a basic utility. They are stand-alone and as simple as I can.
The idea is to write simple scripts, and then use them like Lego blocks to build up other scripts. They
will be fully commented, so feel free to use the code for yourself.

ADVANCED folder contains the real deal: fully developed (or release candidate) utilities based on scripts.
Those will make specific tasks, and sometimes they will use some of the BASIC scripts. In that case, the
script will have all needed in it's folder, and it will be ready to run. Look at README file for
description and modding options.

I won't have any "In development" folder. If a script is under development, the folder name will reflect
it. Otherwise, suppose it's ready to deploy (but read it first!).

You will find each script in its own folder, containing the following items:

- README file.
- CHANGELOG file.
- Code file/folder.

I like to write stand-alone, full-compatible scripts that I can combine and even make some tasks a
little more automatic. As far as I can, I'll try to connect some scripts with others, looking for a
fully automated task, but they will be here as stand-alone versions. Inside the code you will find 
commented lines that connect with other scripts. Look at the README file to learn how to make those
connections work.


WHY I DO THIS

I like scripting. Actually, I like it more than programming. I think it is the idea of developing
a PnP code that makes it so attractive to me.

If you worked as IT support, you may have found yourself in a huge company, without even the most
basic automatic measures (automatic deployment is a wet, wild dream for some of us).

I started developing some of this tools as a time-saver and pastime in some long, lazy evenings.
IT support has some non-stop days and some very long days with nothing to do, so I developed this
tools in an attempt to reduce the number of those non-stop days and increase the number of the
long, lazy days.

So, if you are looking for some spare time (or you are in desperately need of some), may this tools
help you.


PLAGIARISM AND CODE REUSAL

I learned how to script thanks to a lot of anonymous programmers. Sometimes, I reused code from others
and sometimes I adapted it to fulfill an specific task. Other times, they gave me the point I needed
to get to the solution. Thanks to all of you.

I think that the fair thing is to give everyone its share. I wrote down each and every line of the code
I uploaded. But you may think 'Hey, this guy is uploading some of my code'. In that case, let me know
that fact. If you provide me proofs that you wrote it before me (including a link to your source), I won't
delete the code (I use this as repository), but you will appear as author wherever I use the code, and I'll
link directly to your code folder.


CONTACT

No contact data is available at the moment.


DISCLAIMER

I'm not a developer, just an IT support looking for faster deployment techniques and automating
tasks outside a domain network.

This code is not intended for direct deployment (each machine si different), so read it first and
make a couple tries before deployment. Some of them could be rather destroying if used incorrectly
(the kind of destruction crackers love).

So, let's make this clear:

This code is provided "as is", with no warranty either implicit or explicit. You run it at your own
risk, and I may not be liable for any damage it could make to your devices. You have been warned.

Personal note: if you are such a fool to run other-people code without first having a look at it,
you deserve whatever harm it could make to you.
